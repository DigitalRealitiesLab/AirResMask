# Software

We use the [ESP32 library](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) of Espressif for programming the board.
In the folder ''Electronics'' you can find a file to program the circuit board, as well as the [ESP32Servo](https://github.com/madhephaestus/ESP32Servo) library. To upload the software to the board you need a SH-U09C2 or similar USB adapter.

You can find more ways to read and process SFML3300 sensor data [here](https://github.com/MyElectrons/sfm3300-arduino).
